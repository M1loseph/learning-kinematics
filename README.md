## Basics of kinematics implemented in Processing environment

### Forward kinematrics arm

Simple forward kinematics example. When you press a mouse button and move a joint in the arm, all following segments move adequately.

### Reverse kinematics worm

A virtual worm follows the `sin` function from -PI to PI, and then goes back over the `-sin` function. All segments follow one another, creating an illusion of living body.

### Reverse kinematrics 2 DOF arm

Implementation of a simple reverse kinematics with arm that has two degrees of freedom. The end of a manipulator follows the circle and the two joint angles are calculated in order to achive a desired position.

### Reverse kinematics 2 DOF arm in 3D

Imeplementation of an arm with 2DOF in the vertical axis and one deggee of feedom in the horizontal one. The end of a manipulator follows a rectangle border.

### Reverse kinematics 3 DOF in 2D

This time around the arm follows the mouse cursor. You can manipulate the end effector angle using a mouse wheel. This demonstration (unlike other github uploads) is simply a gif.
